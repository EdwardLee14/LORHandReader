Hi! This is the first ever project I started on to learn HTML, CSS, and JS. I worked on it intermittently whenever I had the time to learn some of the basics of web development. 


Including the learning process, I probably spent somewhere around 100 - 125 hours on this project, though if I tried to build it now with the knowledge I've gained, I think I could finish it in around 20 hours. There's a suprising amount of depth in this project due to the constant interactions with the DOM, as well as the code for the undo function. I spent a huge amount of time condensing the JS code and making it more readable - it started out as maybe 2000-3000 lines of code, and I shortened it to ~700 lines.

It went through a bunch of iterations, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out as a first project. I've personally used it to climb to be the rank 1 player on the North American leaderboard for [Legends of Runeterra](https://playruneterra.com/en-us/), as well as top 8 in Aegis League (International Invitational) and top 32 in North American Seasonal Tournaments.
