Hi! This is the first ever project I started on to learn HTML, CSS, and JS. I worked on it intermittently whenever I had the time to learn some of the basics of web development. 
Including the learning process, I probably spent somewhere around 100 - 125 hours on this project. It went through a bunch of iterations, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out as a first project.
