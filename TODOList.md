# MVP

## JavaScript Stuff
- Next Turn should attempt to draw a card
- Card Numbers and labels need to be updated for drawn cards
- New buttons need to be added for new card types (equipment, reduced cost)
- Other types of draw need to work (and add labels to cards)
- Predicted Draw should move to labels
- User input needs to be allowed to add custom labels
- Token should remove the label instead of adding more
- Move to End needs to be created

## CSS Stuff
- Blue background behind cards should be made more appealing 
    (lor board backgrounds, custom design, curved edges, etc.)
- Buttons should be seperated into 2 categories: cardManipulators, labelManipulators
- Buttons should be redesigned to have a similar color palette to blue background redesign
- Turn counter should be updated accordingly to fit in with the redesign


# To Do List aftwerwards:
## Mulligan Function:
- Set Number of cards in HTML to 4 cards
- Buttons should be hidden and replaced with Mulligan buttons to begin
- new button that says confirm after user selects which cards were mulliganed
- Buttons / Turn counter should reappear after user selects confirm (the mulligan)
- Turn counter should be set to one and auto-draw a card
- Card labels for the initial 4 cards should indicate which ones were kept / mulliganed
## Animations
- Simple Fade-out for mulligan buttons into the rest of the buttons
- Card drawing / discarding animation? At least slow down the cards moving so it's not instantaneous
